# <h1>Arithmetic Sequence Calculator</h1>

This Python script calculates and displays an arithmetic sequence based on user inputs. It uses the `colorama` library to enhance the command-line interface with color.

## Features
- Prompts the user to input:
  - Starting number
  - Last number
  - Common difference
- Calculates and displays the arithmetic sequence.
- Computes and shows the total sum of the sequence.
- Provides error handling for invalid inputs.
